The commands to run the program are in the commands.txt file. If copying and pasting doesn't work, then try to copy them by hand before taking points off. The input.txt file contains the input for after the commands are run. The output.txt file contains the output of the program after the commands are run (I annotated it so it's not exactly what shows up).

Overall, I think that my degree of success with this project is pretty complete. I would give myself a 97% for this. The reason why I didn't give myself 100% is that the number of clock cycles and the number of machine instructions, the ProgramCounter and the location value at 100 don't exactly match the requirements shown in assignment 3. Even though the number of clock cycles at machine instructions probably don't necessarily matter, I feel that I still deserve to not get 100% because it means that even though my program is mostly working, it takes longer than what was expected to finish running the program. Therefore, I feel that the program that I submitted is not 100% the correct program and therefore I gave myself 97%.

This assignment was kind of hard to approach mostly because it was very confusing to take in and understand at first. The professor effectively gave us about a week to do and submit this assignment which wasn't exactly the best amount of time. I had to break up this assignment into smaller chunks and tackle them one at a time in order to be able to digest and handle this. The first challenge I had to tackle is to get the hang of this whole masm, mic1 thing. Next, I had to slowly look over and get the hang of this whole mic1 language thing. The next step for me was to decide how exactly to change the ifib.asm program such that it becomes recursive rather than iterative. Luckily for me, I didn't really need to touch or change most of the program that the professor already gave us other than the fib function, so the assignment wasn't too hard for me. Nevertheless, all this new stuff was still a little overwhelming for me, which is the reason why I couldn't really submit this assignment on time before the due date.

The issues that I was not able to resolve for this was to adjust the number of clock cycles, program counter, location value at 100, and the number of machine instructions such that it matches what assignment 3 says. As far as I know, the basic requirements of the assignment should produce the correct output. Nevertheless, I still feel that it is necessary to include these issues so that there won't be any confusion over whether it can't technically counts as an error.
