Overall, this was a very hard assignment for me. Approaching this project was very difficult mainly because of the complexity and it's demanding requirements. In addition, I was dealing with personal issues so I was disabled from doing much schoolwork during that time. I successfully modified the code for the right shift and the multiplication but for some reason I can't get the masm to work. It just continuously loads nonstop. For the division I could not do anything about it. Sorry that It is so late and that it is so incomplete, please go easy on the grading in every way possible.
